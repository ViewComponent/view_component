Where should I put the security.txt file?
For websites, the security.txt file should be placed under the /.well-known/ path 
(/.well-known/security.txt) [RFC8615]. It can also be placed in the root directory
<<< (/security.txt) of a website, especially if the /.well-known/ directory cannot be used for technical reasons, or simply as a fallback. 
The file can be placed in both locations of a website at the same time.

Are there any settings I should apply to the file?
The security.txt file should have an Internet Media Type of text/plain and must be served over HTTPS.

Will adding an email address expose me to spam bots?
The email value is an optional field. If you are worried about spam, you can set a URI as the value and link to your security policy
