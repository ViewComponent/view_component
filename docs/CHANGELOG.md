## 4.0.0

Two years after releasing [3.0.0](https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/releases/tag/v3.0.0) and almost six years since [1.0.0](https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/releases/tag/v1.0.0), we're proud to ship ViewComponent 4. This release marks a shift towards a Long Term Support model for the project, having reached significant feature maturity. While contributions are always welcome, we're unlikely to accept further breaking changes or major feature additions.

Please report any issues at [https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/issues](https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/issues).

### Breaking changes (production)

* Remove dependency on `ActionView::Base`, eliminating the need for capture compatibility patch. In some edge cases, this change may require switching to use the `helpers.` proxy.
* Require [non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/rails) Rails (`>= 7.1.0`) and Ruby (`>= 3.2.0`).
* Remove `render_component` and `render` monkey patch configured with `render_monkey_patch_enabled`.
* Remove deprecated `use_helper(s)`. Use `include MyHelper` or `helpers.` proxy instead.
* Support compatibility with `Dry::Initializer`. As a result, `EmptyOrInvalidInitializerError` will no longer be raised.
* Remove default initializer from `ViewComponent::Base`. Previously, `ViewComponent::Base` defined a catch-all initializer that allowed components without an initializer defined to be passed arbitrary arguments.
* Remove `use_deprecated_instrumentation_name` configuration option. Events will always use `render.view_component` name.
* Remove unnecessary `#format` methods that returned `nil`.
* Remove support for variant names containing `.` to be consistent with Rails.
* Rename internal methods to have `__vc_` prefix if they shouldn't be used by consumers. Make internal constants private. Make `Collection#components`, `Slotable#register_polymorphic_slot` private. Remove unused `ComponentError` class.
* Use ActionView's `lookup_context` for picking templates instead of the request format.

  3.15 added support for using templates that match the request format, that is if `/resource.csv` is requested then
  ViewComponents would pick `_component.csv.erb` over `_component.html.erb`.

  With this release, the request format is no longer considered and instead ViewComponent will use the Rails logic for picking the most appropriate template type, that is the csv template will be used if it matches the `Accept` header or because the controller uses a `respond_to` block to pick the response format.

### Breaking changes (dev/test)

* Rename `config.generate.component_parent_class` to `config.generate.parent_class`.
* Remove `config.test_controller` in favor of `vc_test_controller_class` test helper method.
* `config.component_parent_class` is now `config.generate.component_parent_class`, moving the generator-specific option to the generator configuration namespace.
* Move previews-related configuration (`enabled`, `route`, `paths`, `default_layout`, `controller`) to under `previews` namespace.
* `config.view_component_path` is now `config.generate.path`, as components have long since been able to exist in any directory.
* `--inline` generator option now generates inline template. Use `--call` to generate `#call` method.
* Remove broken integration with `rails stats` that ignored components outside of `app/components`.
* Remove `preview_source` functionality. Consider using [Lookbook](https://lookbook.build/) instead.
* Use `Nokogiri::HTML5` instead of `Nokogiri::HTML4` for test helpers.
* Move generators to a ViewComponent namespace.

  Before, ViewComponent generators pollute the generator namespace with a bunch of top level items, and claim the generic "component" name.

  Now, generators live in a "view_component" module/namespace, so what was before `rails g
  component` is now `rails g view_component:component`.

### New features

* Add `SystemSpecHelpers` for use with RSpec.
* Add support for including `Turbo::StreamsHelper`.
* Add template annotations for components with `def call`.
* Graduate `SlotableDefault` to be included by default.
* Add `#current_template` accessor and `Template#path` for diagnostic usage.
* Reduce string allocations during compilation.
* Add `around_render` lifecyle method for wrapping component rendering in custom instrumentation, etc.

### Bug fixes

* Fix bug where virtual path wasn't reset, breaking translations outside of components.
* Fix bug where `config.previews.enabled` didn't function properly in production environments.
* Fix bug in `SlotableDefault` where default couldn't be overridden when content was passed as a block.
* Fix bug where request-aware helpers didn't work outside of the request context.
* `ViewComponentsSystemTestController` shouldn't be useable outside of test environment

### Non-functional changes

* Remove unnecessary usage of `ruby2_keywords`.
* Remove unnecessary `respond_to` checks.
* Require MFA when publishing to RubyGems.
* Clean up project dependencies, relaxing versions of development gems.
* Add test case for absolute URL path helpers in mailers.
* Update documentation on performance to reflect more representative benchmark showing 2-3x speed increase over partials.
* Add documentation note about instrumentation negatively affecting performance.
* Remove unnecessary ENABLE_RELOADING test suite flag.
* `config.previews.default_layout` should default to nil.
* Add test coverage for uncovered code.
* Test against `turbo-rails` `v2` and `rspec-rails` `v7`.

## 4.0.0.rc5

* Revert change setting `#format`. In GitHub's codebase, the change led to hard-to-detect failures. For example, components rendered from controllers included layouts when they didn't before. In other cases, the response `content_type` changed, breaking downstream consumers. For cases where a specific content type is needed, use:

```ruby
respond_to do |f|
  f.html_fragment do
    render(MyComponent.new)
  end
end
```

    *Joel Hawksley*

## 4.0.0.rc4

* Fix issue where generators were not included in published gem.

    *Jean-Louis Giordano*

## 4.0.0.rc3

* Reformat the avatars section to arrange them in a grid.

    *Josh Cohen*

* Fix bug where relative paths in `translate` didn't work in blocks passed to ViewComponents.

    *Joel Hawksley*

* Add SerpApi to "Who uses ViewComponent" list.

    *Andy from SerpApi*

## 4.0.0.rc2

* Add `around_render` lifecyle method for wrapping component rendering in custom instrumentation, etc.

    *Joel Hawksley*, *Blake Williams*

## 3.12.0

* Remove offline links from resources.

    *Paulo Henrique Meneses*

* Fix templates not being correctly populated when caller location label has a prefix.

  On the upstream version of Ruby, method owners are now included in backtraces as prefixes. This caused the call stack filtering to not work as intended and thus `source_location` to be incorrect for child ViewComponents, consequently not populating templates correctly.

    *Allan Pires, Jason Kim*

* Use component path for generating RSpec files.

  When generating new RSpec files for components, the generator will use the `view_component_path` value in the config to decide where to put the new spec file. For instance, if the `view_component_path` option has been changed to `app/views/components`, the generator will put the spec file in `spec/views/components`. **If the `view_component_path` doesn't start with `app/`, then the generator will fall back to `spec/components/`.**

  This feature is enabled via the `config.view_component.generate.use_component_path_for_rspec_tests` option, defaulting to `false`. The default will change to `true` in ViewComponent v4.

    *William Mathewson*

## 3.11.0

    *Nick Coyne*

* Update CI configuration to use `Appraisal`.

### v3.0.0

1,000+ days and 100+ releases later, the 200+ contributors to ViewComponent are proud to ship v3.0.0!

We're so grateful for all the work of community members to get us to this release. Whether it’s filing bug reports, designing APIs in long-winded discussion threads, or writing code itself, ViewComponent is built by the community, for the community. We couldn’t be more proud of what we’re building together :heart:

This release makes the following breaking changes, many of which have long been deprecated:

* BREAKING: Remove deprecated slots setter methods. Use `with_SLOT_NAME` instead.

    *Joel Hawksley*

For example:

```diff
<%= render BlogComponent.new do |component| %>
-  <% component.header do %>
+  <% component.with_header do %>
    <%= link_to "My blog", root_path %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

* BREAKING: Remove deprecated SlotsV1 in favor of current SlotsV2.

    *Joel Hawksley*

* BREAKING: Remove deprecated `content_areas` feature. Use Slots instead.

    *Joel Hawksley*

* BREAKING: Remove deprecated support for loading ViewComponent engine manually. Make sure `require "view_component/engine"` is removed from `Gemfile`.

    *Joel Hawksley*

* BREAKING: Remove deprecated `generate_*` methods. Use `generate.*` instead.

    *Joel Hawksley*

* BREAKING: Remove deprecated `with_variant` method.

    *Joel Hawksley*

    *Joel Hawksley*

* BREAKING: Raise `TranslateCalledBeforeRenderError`, `ControllerCalledBeforeRenderError`, or `HelpersCalledBeforeRenderError` instead of `ViewContextCalledBeforeRenderError`.

    *Joel Hawksley*

    *Joel Hawksley*

* BREAKING: Rename `SlotV2` to `Slot` and `SlotableV2` to `Slotable`.

    *Joel Hawksley*

* BREAKING: Incorporate `PolymorphicSlots` into `Slotable`. To migrate, remove any references to `PolymorphicSlots` as they are no longer necessary.

    *Joel Hawksley*

* BREAKING: Rename private TestHelpers#controller, #build_controller, #request, and #preview_class to avoid conflicts. Note: While these methods were undocumented and marked as private, they were accessible in tests. As such, we're considering this to be a breaking change.

    *Joel Hawksley*

    *Joel Hawksley*

* Add `config.view_component.use_consistent_rendering_lifecycle` to ensure side-effects in `content` are consistently evaluated before components are rendered. This change effectively means that `content` is evaluated for every component render where `render?` returns true.

    *Simon Fish*

## 2.65.0

* Raise `ArgumentError` when conflicting Slots are defined.

    Before this change it was possible to define Slots with conflicting names, for example:

    ```ruby
    class MyComponent < ViewComponent::Base
      renders_one :item
      renders_many :items
    end
    ```

    *Joel Hawksley*

## 2.64.0

* Add `warn_on_deprecated_slot_setter` flag to opt-in to deprecation warning.

    In [v2.54.0](https://viewcomponent.org/CHANGELOG.html#2540), the Slots API was updated to require the `with_*` prefix for setting Slots. The non-`with_*` setters will be deprecated in a coming version and removed in `v3.0`.

    To enable the coming deprecation warning, add `warn_on_deprecated_slot_setter`:

    ```ruby
    class DeprecatedSlotsSetterComponent < ViewComponent::Base
      warn_on_deprecated_slot_setter
    end
    ```

    *Joel Hawksley*

* Add [`m`](https://rubygems.org/gems/m) to development environment.

    *Daniel Scheffknecht*

## 2.62.0

* Remove the experimental global output buffer feature.
* Restore functionality that used to attempt to compile templates on each call to `#render_in`.

    *Cameron Dutro*

    *Vikram Dighe*

* Add HappyCo to list of companies using ViewComponent.

    *Josh Clayton*

* Add predicate method support to polymorphic slots.

    *Graham Rogers*

## 2.61.1

* Revert `Expose Capybara DSL methods directly inside tests.` This change unintentionally broke other Capybara methods and thus introduced a regression. We aren't confident that we can fail forward so we have decided to revert this change.

    *Joel Hawksley, Blake Williams*

* Revert change making content evaluation consistent.

    *Blake Williams*

* Pin `rails` `main` dependency due to incompatibility with Global Output Buffer.

    *Joel Hawksley*

## 2.61.0

* Ensure side-effects in `content` are consistently evaluated before components are rendered. This change effectively means that `content` is evaluated for every component render where `render?` returns true. As a result, code that is passed to a component via a block/content will now always be evaluated, before `#call`, which can reveal bugs in existing components.

    *Blake Williams*

## 2.60.0

* Add support for `render_preview` in RSpec tests.

    *Thomas Hutterer*
