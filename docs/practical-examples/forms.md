## Before you start

It's important to understand the building blocks of forms in Ruby on Rails before attempting to use `ViewComponent` to enhance them.

Please refer to the official documentation and Rails Guides to get up to speed.

- `ActionView` form helpers [visit](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html){:target="_blank"}
- `ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder` [visit](https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html){:target="_blank"}

After reading these, you should have a good understanding of:

- The `form_with` helper used to create an HTML `<form>`
- `FormBuilder` and the instance yielded to the `form_with` block
- The different helper methods you can call on the `FormBuilder` instance to create input fields (e.g. `form.text_field`)
- The conventions set by Rails to [name parameters](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#understanding-parameter-naming-conventions){:target="_blank"}

## Using form helpers inside a `ViewComponent`

If your component needs to render a form, you can use the `form_with` helpers just as you would in a Rails template or partial

```ruby
# app/components/comment_form_component.rb
class CommentFormComponent < ApplicationComponent
  def initialize(comment:)
    @comment = comment
  end
  attr_reader :comment
end
```

```erb
<!-- app/components/comment_form_component.html.erb -->
<%= form_with(model: comment) do |form| %>
  <%= form.label :content %>
  <%= form.text_area :content %>
<% end %>
```

## Creating your own input elements

As your application grows, you might want to create more complex input types comprised of labels, inputs, wrapping
divs, error messages, hints etc. To do this, Rails allows you to overwrite or create new form helpers.

We'll use the simple example presented above to demonstrate how to create an abstraction for a field with input and
label.

### Using `FormBuilder` methods

The first level of abstraction you can use is to create a new `FormBuilder` for your application and create your new
helper method called `text_area_with_label`. Note that this form builder inherits from
`ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder` which provides all default form builder methods for you.

üí° To understand how `FormBuilder` works, it's a good idea to see how the [default class](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/actionview/lib/action_view/helpers/form_helper.rb){:target="_blank"} in Rails defines helpers

```ruby
# app/form_builders/your_custom_form_builder.rb
# The name of the folder doesn't really matter as long as it's inside
# your app folder for rails to autoload it.

class YourCustomFormBuilder < ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder
  def text_area_with_label(attribute, **options)
    @template.capture do
      @template.concat label(attribute, options.merge(class: 'your-css-classes')
      @template.concat text_area(attribute, options.merge(class: 'your-css-classes')
    end
  end
end
```

To use `YourCustomFormBuilder` you can either define it in your controllers or directly as an argument to `form_with`. In this example, we'll pass it as an argument to `form_with`

```erb
<!-- app/components/comment_form_component.html.erb -->
<%= form_with(model: comment, builder: YourCustomFormBuilder) do |form| %>
  <%= form.text_area_with_label :content %>
<% end %>
```

### Using View Components

For simple markup the example above might be just fine. However, writing a lot of markup using `capture`,
`content_tag`, etc. and concatenating using `concat` or `+` might not be too easy. For this purpose you can abstract
the markup to a ViewComponent.

#### ‚õîÔ∏è Discouraged: Passing the FormBuilder instance to a ViewComponent

```erb
<!-- app/components/comment_form_component.html.erb -->
<%= form_with(model: comment) do |form| %>
  <%= render TextAreaWithLabelComponent.new(form: form) %>
<% end %>
```

Even though this is technically possible*, it's not very idiomatic within the context of Rails forms to do so. Rails
already provides a stable api to interact with forms.

\* _There is a [known issue](#gotchas-and-known-issues) in `ViewComponent` when doing this but passing a
`FormBuilder` instance is a common enough pattern to grant showing it here._

#### ‚úÖ Encouraged: Abstract the markup into a ViewComponent

In order to clean up your `FormBuilder` and be able to test the markup in isolation, you can extract the code inside the form builder method into a `ViewComponent`. This is very similar to what [Rails' internals](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/d3f4db9e95a475822c02b29241a5d07cbcff6fd5/actionview/lib/action_view/helpers/form_helper.rb#L1151){:target="_blank"} do to create their default form helpers.

Let's extract the code from the previous example into a `ViewComponent`

```ruby
class YourCustomFormBuilder < ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder
  # Note: (attribute, **options) is an oversimplification of the arguments passed into
  # a form builder method and a ViewComponent. Take a look at the links above to understand
  # how default form builder methods work, which arguments they receive, etc.
  def text_area_with_label(attribute, **options)
    @template.render TextAreaWithLabelComponent.new(attribute: attribute, **options)
  end
end
```

```ruby
class TextAreaWithLabelComponent < ApplicationComponent
  def initialize(attribute:, **options)
    @attribute = attribute
  end
  attr_reader :attribute
end
```

```erb
<!-- app/components/text_area_with_label_component.html.erb -->
<div class='maybe-some-wrapper-class'>
  <%= label_tag attribute, class: 'your-label-css-classes' %>
  <%= text_area_tag attribute, class: 'your-text-area-classes' %>
</div>
```

```erb
<!-- app/components/comment_form_component.html.erb -->
<%= form_with(model: comment, builder: YourCustomFormBuilder) do |form| %>
  <%= form.text_area_with_label :content %>
<% end %>
```

#### Writing input elements in vanilla HTML

Nothing is really stopping you from using regular `<input>` tags instead of Rails' helper methods. However, it is important for your own implementations to follow the conventions set by other form helpers. If you plan to do so, please read the [Understanding Parameter Naming Conventions](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#understanding-parameter-naming-conventions){:target="_blank"} section of the `form_helpers` Rails guide.

## Gotchas and Known Issues

### Passing the form builder object to a `ViewComponent`

In the previous section we discouraged passing an instance of a `FormBuilder` to a `ViewComponent` to create new input types. However, there are legitimate cases to do this. For example, it is common in some Rails applications to extract the fields of a form into their own partial:

```console
/app
  /views
    /comments
      new.html.erb
      edit.html.erb
      _form.html.erb
      _fields.html.erb
```

```erb
# form.html.erb
<%= form_with(model: comment) do |form| %>
  <%= render 'fields', form: form %>
<% end %>
```

```erb
# fields.html.erb
<%= form.label :content %>
<%= form.text_area :content %>
```

This is currently *not supported* by `ViewComponent`. Please refer to the following [issue](https://github.com/github/view_component/issues/241){:target="_blank"} to track support for this.
