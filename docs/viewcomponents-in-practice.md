# ViewComponents in practice

_GitHub's guide to building component-driven UI in Rails, shared publicly due to interest from the community. Consider it to be more opinion than fact._

## Why we use ViewComponents

We built the ViewComponent framework to help manage the growing complexity of the GitHub.com view layer. We've accumulated thousands of templates over the years, almost entirely through copy-pasting. A lack of abstraction made it difficult to make sweeping design, accessibility, and behavior improvements.

ViewComponent gives us a way to isolate common UI patterns for reuse, helping us improve the quality and consistency of the customer experience.

## Everything is a ViewComponent

Our goal is to build all of GitHub's Rails-rendered HTML with ViewComponents, composed of [Primer ViewComponents](https://primer.style/view-components/).

Using Primer ViewComponents ensures that our user interfaces are consistent, accessible, and correctly designed.

## The two types of ViewComponents we write

We build our views using ViewComponents that generally fall into two categories: general-purpose and app-specific.

### General-purpose ViewComponents

General-purpose ViewComponents implement common UI patterns. At GitHub, we open-source these components as [Primer ViewComponents](https://primer.style/view-components/).

### App-specific ViewComponents

App-specific ViewComponents translate a domain object (often an ActiveRecord model) into one or more general-purpose components.

For example: we have a `User::AvatarComponent` that accepts a `User` ActiveRecord object and renders a `Primer::AvatarComponent`.

## Implementation

### Extract general-purpose ViewComponents

"Good frameworks are extracted, not invented" - [DHH](https://dhh.dk/arc/000416.html)

Just as ViewComponent itself was extracted from GitHub.com, our experience has shown that the best general-purpose components are those extracted from the GitHub application once they've proven useful across more than one area.

Our process typically follows the following steps:

1. Single use-case component implemented in application.
2. Component adapted for general use in multiple locations in application.
3. Component extracted into [Primer ViewComponents](https://primer.style/view-components/).

### Reduce permutations

As we build ViewComponents, we should look for opportunities to consolidate similar patterns into a single implementation. We tend to follow typical DRY practices in this regard, such as abstracting once there are three or more similar instances.

### Avoid global state

The more a ViewComponent is dependent on global state (such as request parameters or the current URL), the less likely it is to be reusable. Avoid implicit coupling to global state, instead passing it into the component explicitly. Thorough unit testing is a good way to ensure decoupling from global state.

### Avoid inline Ruby in ViewComponent templates

Avoid writing inline Ruby in ViewComponent templates. Try using an instance method on the ViewComponent instead.
